Pico 60 is a polyphonic synthetizer, with 6 analog voices, controlled by an RP2350B custom board. The name pico-60 comes from the first iteration of the project, which used a Raspberry Pi pico board. Later i opted for a 2350B for various reasons: more gpios, higher speeds, more ADCS, more accurate PSU, and i was also curious about RISC-V compiling.
The uC only sends GATE (1 or 0) and FREQUENCY (freq of the note played), technically it also sends a compensation voltage, which gets converted to constant current to compensate the amplitude of the saw wave diminishing as its frequency rises.
The rest of manipulation sound and parameter wise is done in the analog realm via pots on the synth.
