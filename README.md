Pico 60 is a polyphonic synthetizer, with 6 analog voices, controlled by an RP2350B custom board. The name pico-60 comes from the first iteration of the project, which used a Raspberry Pi pico board, and was inspired by the juno 60 architecture. Later i opted for a 2350B for various reasons: more gpios, higher speeds, more ADCS, more accurate PSU, and i was also curious about RISC-V compiling, and also got further from the juno architecture, but i like the name.
The uC sends GATE (1 or 0), FREQUENCY (freq of the note played) and a compensation voltage, which gets converted to constant current to compensate the amplitude of the saw wave diminishing as its frequency rises.
The uC also scans keys to know which octave settings is set, scans with adc to shift the pitch, either via LFO or a joystick.
The rest of manipulation sound and parameter wise is done in the analog realm via pots on the synth.
